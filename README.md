# A Dao of Web design
## By *Cailee Mitchell*

As designers, we are ultimately tasked with keeping up with the internetâ€™s ever-changing ways.

Things are borrowed and ideas are tossed away *constantly*. 

These ideas and borrowed tactics are eventually formed into sensible, adaptable concepts.

### A Summary

There are many factors that make this adaptability difficult at times; such as poor eyesight, screen resolution, and the platform being utilized. You need to consider the following in order to have a successful outcome - focus on what your page will do, avoid HTML for presentation purposes, and never rely on style sheets to provide an accessible page. How do you create a successful page then? You can use style sheets to aid the appearance of your page, not for control, and use proper percentages in CSS page layouts. Or perhaps you choose to place your colors sparingly and avoid point and pixel sizing. Different readers and different platforms call for endless ways to make your page adaptable for all. Instead of worrying about the appearance of your page and the dpi difference between Mac and PC, worry about your audience and functionality. This will prepare both you and your page for success, readability, and most importantly - adaptability.
